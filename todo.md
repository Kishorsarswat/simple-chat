## ToDo:
 - One chat room

 - Async server that:

    - Tracks connected users

    - Enforces unique usernames

    - Broadcasts messages to everyone except sender

    - Cleans up on leave or disconnect

 - Async CLI client that:

    - Connects automatically

    - Sends commands

    - Displays incoming messages concurrently

 - High throughput, low memory

 - Non-blocking everywhere
